# SQL_Practice
Performing various tasks using database 'dvdrental' in 'PgAdmin 4' using 'jupyter notebook'.
This project focuses on strengthening SQL skills through practical, real-world data analysis scenarios. It involves working with structured datasets to write and optimize queries for data extraction, transformation, aggregation, and reporting. The project simulates tasks typically performed in a data analyst roleâ€”such as analyzing sales performance, customer segmentation, inventory tracking, and business KPIs.

Key SQL concepts practiced include:

Writing complex JOINs to merge tables

Using GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions for summaries

Applying window functions for ranking and trend analysis

Creating Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for readable and modular queries

Implementing subqueries and nested queries to solve multi-step problems

Performing data cleaning and transformation using functions like CASE, COALESCE, and string manipulation

The outcome of this project is a set of well-documented SQL scripts and query results that can serve as a portfolio piece to showcase problem-solving ability, logical thinking, and proficiency in SQL for business analytics.
